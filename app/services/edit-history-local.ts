// Client-side edit history using IndexedDB
//
// Design: CachedFile.content (cache) always holds the latest file content.
// Each file has one CachedEditHistoryEntry with diffs[]: array of diff entries.
//
// Auto-save (saveLocalEdit):
//   Called BEFORE cache is updated. Reads old content from cache.
//   - If diffs is empty or last diff is empty (commit marker):
//     base = oldContent, compute diff(base, newContent), append or replace last.
//   - If last diff is non-empty:
//     reverse-apply last diff to oldContent → base, diff(base, newContent), overwrite last.
//
// addCommitBoundary:
//   Adds empty diff entry as commit boundary. Next saveLocalEdit starts new session.
//   Called on file open/reload/pull, temp diff accept, resolve conflict (remote).
