## File-Type-Specific Editors

`MainViewer` switches the display component based on file extension and MIME type.

### Text Files

| Extension | Editor | Modes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| `.md` | MarkdownFileEditor | Preview / WYSIWYG / Raw |
| `.yaml`, `.yml` | WorkflowEditor | Visual / YAML |
| `.html`, `.htm` | HtmlFileEditor | Preview / Raw |
| Other (`.txt`, `.js`, `.json`, etc.) | TextFileEditor | Raw only |

### Binary Files

| MIME Type | Display |
|-----------|---------|
| `image/*` | `<img>` image display |
| `video/*` | `<video>` player |
| `audio/*` | `<audio>` player |
| `application/pdf` | iframe preview |

Binary files show Temp Download / Temp Upload buttons for local editing and download.

### Encrypted Files

Files with the `.encrypted` extension are handled by `EncryptedFileViewer`. After entering a password for decryption, the content can be edited as plain text. The password is cached for the session, enabling auto-decryption.

### Plugin Extensions

Plugins can register extensions and components in `mainViews` to add custom editors for new file types.

---

## Markdown Editor

Markdown files (`.md`) have three editing modes.

### Preview Mode

Read-only rendering via `GfmMarkdownPreview`.

- GitHub Flavored Markdown (tables, checklists, strikethrough)
- Code block syntax highlighting (`rehype-highlight`)
- Inline Mermaid diagram rendering

### WYSIWYG Mode

Rich text editing powered by the `wysimark-lite` library.

- Rich text operations: bold, italic, lists, code blocks, etc.
- Editing while preserving markdown syntax
- Image insertion (via Drive file picker)
- Lazy-loaded (dynamic import via `useEffect`)

### Raw Mode

Direct markdown source editing in a plain `<textarea>` with monospace font.

---

## Workflow Editor

Workflow files (`.yaml`, `.yml`) have two editing modes.

### Visual Mode

- Parses YAML via `engine/parser.ts` and converts to a Mermaid flowchart via `workflow-to-mermaid.ts`
- Displayed as an interactive SVG diagram
- Click a node to open the properties panel (right sidebar)

### YAML Mode

- Direct YAML editing in a raw textarea
- Auto-save with 3-second debounce

---

## Auto-Save

All editors use a common auto-save pattern.

1. Save to IndexedDB cache after a **3-second** debounce from content change
2. Flush unsaved content when the editor loses focus (blur)
3. Emit a `file-modified` event on save to update the file tree badge
4. Record changes in the `editHistory` store (for Sync)

Changes are reflected on Drive via a manual Push operation.

---

## Toolbar

A mode switcher and action buttons are displayed at the top of the editor.

### Mode Switcher

Mode toggle buttons depending on file type (e.g., Preview / WYSIWYG / Raw for markdown).

### Action Buttons (`EditorToolbarActions`)

| Button | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Edit History** | Open the edit history modal to view and restore past versions |
| **Diff** | Select a file to compare and display the difference in unified format |
| **Temp Upload** | Generate a temporary edit URL and copy it to clipboard |
| **Temp Download** | Fetch temporary changes and merge them into the editor |

---

## Edit History

Manages local edit history.

- Records a snapshot boundary when a file is opened
- Open the history modal via the Edit History button
- Select any version to restore
- Emits a `file-restored` event on restore to update the editor

---

## Diff View

Compare with any file to view differences.

1. Click the Diff button
2. Select the target file with `QuickOpenDialog`
3. Top: editable textarea (current file), Bottom: unified diff display
4. Uses `createTwoFilesPatch()` from the `diff` package

---

## Temp Edit (Temporary File Sharing)

Enables temporary editing from external tools.

### Temp Upload

1. Click the Temp Upload button in the editor
2. Upload current file content to `/api/drive/temp`
3. A shareable temporary edit URL is copied to clipboard
4. Edit from that URL in an external tool or browser

### Temp Download

1. Click the Temp Download button
2. Check if the temporary file has changes
3. If changes exist, merge them into the editor

---

## Image Insertion

Image insertion flow in WYSIWYG mode:

1. Click the image button in the wysimark editor
2. Select an image file with `QuickOpenDialog` (supported extensions: `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.gif`, `.webp`, `.svg`, `.bmp`, `.ico`)
3. Upload to Drive (`/api/drive/files`, action: `create-image`)
4. Insert the returned Drive file URL as a markdown image link

---

## EditorContext

Context for managing shared editor state (`app/contexts/EditorContext.tsx`).

### Provided Values

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `activeFileId` | `string \| null` | ID of the currently open file |
| `activeFileContent` | `string \| null` | Current file content |
| `activeFileName` | `string \| null` | Current file name |
| `fileList` | `FileListItem[]` | All files from the file tree |

### Selection Tracking

Tracks editor text selection for use with chat panel slash commands (`{selection}`).

- **Raw textarea**: Records `{text, start, end}` on `onSelect` event
- **WYSIWYG**: Monitors DOM selection via `selectionchange` event (`WysiwygSelectionTracker`)
- **Chat access**: Retrieved via `editorCtx.getActiveSelection()`
