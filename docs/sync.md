# Sync

Manual push/pull synchronization between the browser (IndexedDB) and Google Drive.

## Features

- **Manual Sync**: Push and pull changes when you want
- **Offline-First**: Files are cached in IndexedDB for instant access
- **Soft Delete**: Deleted files are moved to a `trash/` folder on Drive (recoverable)
- **Conflict Resolution**: Choose local or remote version with automatic backup
- **Full Push / Full Pull**: Bulk sync for initial setup or recovery
- **Untracked File Management**: Detect, restore, or delete orphaned remote files
- **Trash & Conflict Backup Management**: Restore or permanently delete trashed files and conflict backups

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Push** | Upload local changes (incremental) |
| **Pull** | Download remote changes (incremental) |
| **Full Push** | Upload all modified files + merge metadata into remote |
| **Full Pull** | Download entire remote vault (skip matching hashes) |

Header buttons: Push and Pull buttons are always visible. Badge shows count of pending changes (including locally modified files).

## How Sync Works

### Overview

The system tracks file states using metadata:
- **Local Meta**: Stored in IndexedDB (`syncMeta` store, key `"current"`)
- **Remote Meta**: `_sync-meta.json` file on Google Drive

Each metadata contains:
- `lastUpdatedAt`: Timestamp of last sync
- `files`: MD5 checksum and modification time for each file (keyed by file ID)

File contents are cached in the IndexedDB `files` store. All edits update this cache directly (no Drive API call). The MD5 checksum in the metadata is only updated during sync operations (Push/Pull) and file reads — it reflects the last-synced state, not the current local content. Local modifications are tracked separately via the `editHistory` store.

### Sync Diff

The diff algorithm compares two metadata snapshots plus a set of locally edited file IDs:

| Input | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Local Meta** | Client's last-synced snapshot (IndexedDB) |
| **Remote Meta** | Server's current snapshot (`_sync-meta.json`, read-only during diff) |
| **locallyModifiedFileIds** | File IDs from IndexedDB `editHistory` (tracks local edits) |

Detection logic per file:

| Local Changed | Remote Changed | Result |
|:-------------:|:--------------:|--------|
| No | No | Skip (unchanged) |
| Yes | No | **toPush** |
| No | Yes | **toPull** |
| Yes | Yes | **Conflict** |
| Local only | - | **localOnly** |
| - | Remote only | **remoteOnly** |

Where:
- `localChanged = locallyModifiedFileIds.has(fileId)` — the `editHistory` store tracks which files have been edited locally since the last sync
- `remoteChanged = localMeta.md5Checksum !== remoteMeta.md5Checksum` — remote meta diverges from local meta when another device has pushed changes

No live Drive API listing is needed: the `drive.file` scope ensures only GemiHub can modify these files, so `_sync-meta.json` is always authoritative.

---

## Push Changes (Incremental)

Uploads locally-changed files to remote.

### Flow

```
1. PRE-CHECK: Diff check before writing anything
   ├─ Read LocalSyncMeta from IndexedDB (may be null on first sync)
   ├─ GET /api/sync → { remoteMeta, syncMetaFileId }
   │   └─ Server: find + read _sync-meta.json, return meta and its file ID
   ├─ Compute diff client-side (localMeta vs remoteMeta + locallyModifiedFileIds)
   └─ Remote has any pending changes (conflicts, toPull, or remoteOnly) → error "Pull first"

2. BATCH UPLOAD: Update all files via single API call
   ├─ Get modified file IDs from IndexedDB editHistory
   ├─ Filter to only files tracked in any known meta (cached remoteMeta, diff remoteMeta, or localMeta)
   ├─ Read all modified file contents from IndexedDB cache
   ├─ POST /api/sync { action: "pushFiles", files, remoteMeta, syncMetaFileId }
   │   └─ Server:
   │       ├─ Use client-provided remoteMeta (skip re-reading _sync-meta.json)
   │       ├─ For each file (parallel, max 5 concurrent):
   │       │   ├─ Read old content from Drive (for edit history)
   │       │   └─ Update file on Drive
   │       ├─ Write _sync-meta.json once via syncMetaFileId (skip findFileByExactName)
   │       ├─ Save remote edit history in background (best-effort)
   │       └─ Return results + updated remoteMeta
   ├─ Update IndexedDB cache with new md5/modifiedTime
   └─ Update LocalSyncMeta directly from returned remoteMeta

3. CLEANUP
   ├─ Clear IndexedDB editHistory for pushed files only
   ├─ Update localModifiedCount
   └─ Fire "sync-complete" event (UI refresh)

4. RAG (background, non-blocking)
   ├─ Register eligible files in RAG store
   │   └─ Failures recorded as "pending" in RAG tracking meta
   ├─ Save RAG tracking info
   └─ Retry previously pending RAG registrations
```

### Preconditions

| Local Meta | Remote Meta | Remote Newer | Action |
|:----------:|:-----------:|:------------:|--------|
| - | - | - | Nothing to push |
| - | exists | - | Nothing to push |
| any | any | Yes (with pending pulls) | Error: "Pull required" |
| any | any | No | Proceed with Push |

### Important Notes

- Push checks for conflicts and remote-newer **before** writing any files to Drive. If the check fails, nothing is written.
- Push does **NOT** delete remote files. Deletion is handled separately (see Soft Delete below).
- After a successful push, local edit history in IndexedDB is cleared for the pushed files only.

---

## Pull Changes (Incremental)

Downloads only remotely-changed files to local cache.

### Flow

1. **Compute diff** using local meta vs remote meta (with `locallyModifiedFileIds`)
2. **Check conflicts** — if any, stop and show conflict UI
3. **Clean up `localOnly` files** — files that exist locally but were deleted on remote (moved to trash on another device) are removed from IndexedDB cache, edit history, and local sync meta
4. **Combine** `toPull` + `remoteOnly` arrays
5. **Download file contents** in parallel (max 5 concurrent)
6. **Update IndexedDB cache** with downloaded files
7. **Update local sync meta** with new checksums
8. **Update remote sync meta** with pulled files, and **prune `localOnly` entries** from `_sync-meta.json`
9. **Fire "sync-complete" and "files-pulled" events** and update localModifiedCount

### Decision Tables

#### Files in Both Metas

| Local Meta | Remote Meta | Action |
|:----------:|:-----------:|--------|
| A | A | Skip (unchanged) |
| B | A | Skip (local-only change, uploads on next Push) |
| A | B | **Download** (remote changed) |
| B | C | **Conflict** (both changed) |

#### Files Only in Local Meta (Remote Deleted)

| Local Meta | Remote Meta | Action |
|:----------:|:-----------:|--------|
| A | - | **localOnly** → Remove from local cache (remote deletion synced) |

#### Files Only in Remote (New Remote)

| Local Meta | Remote Meta | Action |
|:----------:|:-----------:|--------|
| - | A | **remoteOnly** → Download |

---

## Full Pull

Downloads all remote files, skipping those with matching hashes.

### Flow

1. **Build `skipHashes`** from all IndexedDB cached files (`fileId → md5Checksum`)
2. **Rebuild remote meta** from Drive API (full scan)
3. **Filter out** system files (`_sync-meta.json`, `settings.json`)
4. **Skip** files where `skipHashes[fileId] === remoteMeta.md5Checksum`
5. **Download** all non-skipped files in parallel (max 5 concurrent)
6. **Update IndexedDB cache** with downloaded files
7. **Delete stale cache** — remove cached files that no longer exist on remote
8. **Clear all local edit history** (remote is authoritative)
9. **Replace local sync meta** entirely with remote meta
10. **Fire "sync-complete" event** and update localModifiedCount

### When to Use

- Initial setup on a new device/browser
- Recovery after cache corruption
- When you want remote to be authoritative

---

## Full Push

Uploads all locally modified files directly to Drive and merges metadata. **This is a destructive operation** — it does not check for conflicts or remote changes before overwriting. Remote files will be overwritten without warning.

### Flow

1. **Batch upload** — all modified files are sent in a single `pushFiles` API call; server updates Drive files in parallel (max 5 concurrent), reads/writes `_sync-meta.json` once, and saves remote edit history in background
2. **Update IndexedDB** — cache and LocalSyncMeta updated with new md5/modifiedTime from server response
3. **Clear edit history** — if all eligible files were pushed, clear all edit history; otherwise clear per-file for successfully pushed files only
4. **Fire "sync-complete" event** and update localModifiedCount
5. **RAG registration (background)** — register eligible files, save tracking info, retry pending registrations

### When to Use

- Force remote metadata to match local state
- After bulk local edits that bypassed normal sync
- **Caution:** Unlike incremental Push, Full Push skips conflict detection and may overwrite remote changes made on other devices

---

## Conflict Resolution

Conflicts occur during Push or Pull when both local and remote versions of a file have changed since the last sync.

| Choice | What Happens |
|--------|--------------|
| **Keep Local** | Back up remote to `sync_conflicts/`, upload local content to Drive, update remote meta |
| **Keep Remote** | Back up local to `sync_conflicts/`, download remote content to IndexedDB |

After resolution:
- The resolved file's edit history entry is cleared
- Local sync meta is updated from the server's remote meta
- localModifiedCount is updated

The unselected version is always backed up for manual merging if needed.

### Backup Naming

```
{filename}_{YYYYMMDD_HHmmss}.{ext}
```

Example: `notes/daily.md` → `sync_conflicts/notes_daily_20260207_143000.md`

---

## Soft Delete (Trash)

File deletion uses a soft delete model. Deleted files are moved to a `trash/` subfolder on Google Drive instead of being permanently destroyed.

### Flow

1. User deletes a file (context menu → Trash)
2. Server moves the file to `trash/` subfolder via Drive API (`moveFile`)
3. File is removed from `_sync-meta.json`
4. Local caches (IndexedDB file cache) are cleaned up
5. File tree updates to reflect the removal

### Cross-Device Sync

When a file is deleted on one device:
- The file is moved to `trash/` and removed from remote sync meta
- Other devices detect it as `localOnly` during their next Pull
- Pull automatically removes the file from their local cache

### Recovery

Trashed files can be managed from Settings → Sync → Trash:
- **Restore**: Moves the file back from `trash/` to the root folder and re-adds it to sync meta
- **Permanently Delete**: Removes the file from Drive entirely (irreversible)

---

## Temporary Sync

Quick file sharing without full sync overhead. Use when:
- You want to quickly share a single file across devices
- You need a backup before making risky edits

Files are stored with `__TEMP__/` prefix on Google Drive. **No metadata is updated** — equivalent to making the same edit on both devices manually.

Temp files can be managed from Settings → Sync → Temporary Files.

---

## Chat-Initiated File Operations

When Gemini AI uses `update_drive_file` or `create_drive_file` tools in chat, file operations follow a local-first pattern to stay consistent with push/pull sync.

### update_drive_file (Local-First)

The server does **not** write to Drive. Instead, it reads file metadata only and returns the new content to the client via an SSE `drive_file_updated` chunk.

```
Chat → Server (getFileMetadata only, no Drive write)
     → SSE: drive_file_updated { fileId, fileName, content }
     → Client:
         1. addCommitBoundary(fileId)         — separate previous session
         2. saveLocalEdit(fileId, content)     — record diff in editHistory
         3. setCachedFile(content, old md5)    — update cache, keep last-synced md5
         4. addCommitBoundary(fileId)          — isolate chat edit as own session
         5. dispatch "file-modified"           — update sync badge count
         6. dispatch "file-restored"           — refresh editor if file is open
```

**Sync behavior after update:**
- `localMeta.md5` = old value (unchanged), `remoteMeta.md5` = old value (Drive untouched)
- `editHistory` has the fileId → `locallyModifiedFileIds` includes it
- Diff result: `localChanged = true`, `remoteChanged = false` → **toPush**
- Normal push uploads the new content to Drive

### create_drive_file (Drive + Local Seed)

The server creates the file on Drive (an ID is needed) and returns content + metadata via an SSE `drive_file_created` chunk.

```
Chat → Server (createFile on Drive + upsertFileInMeta)
     → SSE: drive_file_created { fileId, fileName, content, md5Checksum, modifiedTime }
     → Client:
         1. setCachedFile(content, Drive md5)  — seed cache with Drive checksum
         2. setLocalSyncMeta(fileId, Drive md5) — local meta matches remote
         3. dispatch "sync-complete"            — refresh file tree
```

**Sync behavior after create:**
- `localMeta.md5` = Drive value, `remoteMeta.md5` = same Drive value
- Diff result: `localChanged = false`, `remoteChanged = false` → **already synced**
- No push needed

---

## File Recovery

### Scenario 1: Conflict — Need Both Versions

When a conflict occurs, you choose Keep Local or Keep Remote, but the other version is always saved to `sync_conflicts/`.

**To merge manually:**
1. Settings → Sync → Conflict Backups → Manage
2. Select the backup file, edit the restore name if needed
3. Click Restore — the backup is created as a new file in the root folder

### Scenario 2: Recover a Deleted File

Deleted files are moved to the `trash/` folder on Google Drive.

**To recover:**
1. Settings → Sync → Trash → Manage
2. Select the file you need
3. Click Restore — the file is moved back to the root folder and re-tracked

### Scenario 3: Restore from Remote

If you accidentally changed or deleted files locally and want to restore from remote.

**To recover:** Use **Full Pull** — this downloads all remote files, skipping only those with matching hashes. Your local cache is replaced entirely, stale cache files are deleted, and all local edit history is cleared.
