# Encryption

Hybrid RSA+AES encryption for protecting files stored on Google Drive.

## Features

- **Hybrid Encryption**: RSA-OAEP (2048-bit) + AES-256-GCM for each file
- **Password Protection**: Private key encrypted with PBKDF2-derived key (100,000 iterations)
- **Per-File AES Key**: Each encryption generates a fresh AES-256 key
- **Self-Contained Files**: Each encrypted file contains everything needed for decryption (except the password)
- **Client-Side Decryption**: Encrypted files and history records are decrypted in the browser using the Web Crypto API
- **Password Caching**: Enter password once per session
- **Double-Encryption Prevention**: Already-encrypted content is never re-encrypted

## Encrypted File Format

Encrypted files use YAML frontmatter followed by Base64-encoded data:

```
---
encrypted: true
key: <Base64: encrypted private key (IV + AES-GCM ciphertext)>
salt: <Base64: PBKDF2 salt (16 bytes)>
---
<Base64: key_length(2 bytes) + RSA-encrypted AES key + IV(12 bytes) + AES-GCM ciphertext>
```

The `key` and `salt` fields are copied from your encryption settings at the time of encryption. This makes each file self-contained — decryptable with only the password.

## How It Works

### Setup (Once)

```
Password
  → Generate RSA-2048 key pair (SPKI/PKCS8, Base64)
  → Derive AES-256 key from password using PBKDF2 (SHA-256, 100k iterations, random salt)
  → Encrypt private key with derived key (AES-256-GCM)
  → Store in settings: publicKey, encryptedPrivateKey, salt
```

### Encryption (Per File)

```
Plaintext
  → Generate random AES-256 key
  → Encrypt plaintext with AES-256-GCM (random IV)
  → Encrypt AES key with RSA public key (RSA-OAEP, SHA-256)
  → Pack: key_length(2) + encrypted_AES_key + IV(12) + ciphertext
  → Base64 encode → Wrap with YAML frontmatter
```

### Decryption (Per File)

```
Password + salt
  → Derive AES-256 key via PBKDF2
  → Decrypt private key (AES-256-GCM)
  → Unwrap: extract encrypted AES key, IV, ciphertext
  → Decrypt AES key with RSA private key (RSA-OAEP)
  → Decrypt content with AES key (AES-256-GCM)
  → Plaintext
```

## Binary Layout of Encrypted Data

After Base64 decoding the data section:

```
Offset  Length    Content
0       2         AES key length (big-endian uint16)
2       key_len   RSA-OAEP encrypted AES-256 key
2+kl    12        AES-GCM IV (nonce)
2+kl+12 rest      AES-GCM ciphertext (includes 16-byte auth tag)
```

With RSA-2048 and OAEP-SHA256, `key_len` is typically 256 bytes.

## Usage

### Encrypt a File

Right-click a file in the file tree → **Encrypt**. The file content is encrypted and the file is renamed with `.encrypted` extension.

### Open an Encrypted File

Click an `.encrypted` file in the tree. A password prompt appears. Enter your encryption password to view and edit the decrypted content.

The password is cached in memory for the session. Subsequent encrypted files are decrypted automatically.

### Temp Upload / Download

In the encrypted file editor:
- **Temp Upload**: Re-encrypts the edited content and saves to the temp area (for cross-device transfer without full sync)
- **Temp Download**: Fetches temp content, decrypts, and shows a diff for review

### Chat & Workflow History Encryption

When encryption is enabled and `encryptChatHistory` / `encryptWorkflowHistory` are turned on in settings, new chat histories and workflow execution/request records are encrypted before saving to Drive. Older unencrypted records remain readable. When loading an encrypted record, the app decrypts it client-side using your cached private key or prompts for your password.

## Security Notes

- **Password is never stored** — only the encrypted private key and salt are saved in settings
- **Decryption happens in the browser** — encrypted files and history records are decrypted client-side using the Web Crypto API; the server never sees plaintext of encrypted content
- **Encryption for saving uses the public key only** — the server calls the same shared crypto module (`crypto-core.ts`) to encrypt with the public key; no password is needed for encryption
- **Each file has a unique AES key** — compromising one file's AES key does not affect others
- **RSA key pair is generated once** — stored encrypted with your password in settings
- **Forgetting your password means data loss** — there is no recovery mechanism

## Python Decryption Script

Encrypted files are self-contained and can be decrypted without Gemini Hub using the following Python script.

### Requirements

```bash
pip install cryptography
```

### Script

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
