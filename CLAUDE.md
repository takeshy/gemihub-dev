# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Gemini Hub IDE is a self-hosted web application that integrates Google Gemini AI with Google Drive. It provides visual workflow building, AI chat with streaming/function calling, Drive file management with a WYSIWYG editor, and offline-first caching with push/pull sync.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev          # Dev server on http://localhost:5170
npm run build        # Production build (react-router build)
npm run start        # Serve production build (port 8080)
npm run typecheck    # Type generation + TypeScript check (react-router typegen && tsc)
```

No test framework is configured. There are no test files or test scripts.

## Environment

Requires Node.js 22+. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in Google OAuth credentials and session secret. The dev server port (5170) is set in `vite.config.ts`.

## Architecture

**Stack:** React 19 + React Router 7 (SSR) + Tailwind CSS v4 + Vite. All data stored in Google Drive (no database). Browser IndexedDB for client-side caching.

**Path alias:** `~/*` maps to `./app/*` (configured in tsconfig.json).

### Layer Structure

1. **Routes** (`app/routes/`) — React Router pages and API endpoints. Page routes use loaders for server data; API routes handle POST/GET via `action`/`loader` exports.
2. **Services** (`app/services/`) — Server-side business logic. Files ending in `.server.ts` are server-only (never bundled to client). Key services: `gemini-chat.server.ts` (streaming AI), `google-drive.server.ts` (Drive API), `google-auth.server.ts` (OAuth), `mcp-client.server.ts` (MCP JSON-RPC).
3. **Components** (`app/components/`) — React UI organized by feature: `chat/` (chat panel), `flow/` (React Flow workflow editor), `execution/` (workflow execution), `editor/` (markdown editor), `ide/` (main layout and panels).
4. **Engine** (`app/engine/`) — Workflow execution engine. `parser.ts` converts YAML to AST, `executor.ts` runs it via a handler-per-node-type pattern in `handlers/`. Supports 20+ node types (variable, if, while, command, drive ops, HTTP, MCP, prompt).
5. **Hooks** (`app/hooks/`) — `useSync.ts` (push/pull with conflict resolution), `useFileWithCache.ts` (IndexedDB cache-first reads), `useWorkflowExecution.ts` (execution state via SSE).
6. **Utils** (`app/utils/`) — Bidirectional conversion between React Flow graph and YAML workflow, plus Mermaid diagram generation.

### Key Patterns

- **Streaming:** Chat (`/api/chat`) and workflow execution (`/api/workflow/:id/execute`) use SSE (Server-Sent Events). Chunk types include text, thinking, tool_call, tool_result, image_generated, rag_used, web_search_used.
- **Function Calling:** Gemini calls Drive tools (read/search/list/create/update), Google Search, RAG/File Search, and dynamically-discovered MCP tools (prefixed `mcp_{server}_{tool}`).
- **Cache-First Sync:** Files cached in IndexedDB. MD5 hash comparison detects changes. Manual push/pull with conflict resolution dialog.
- **Encryption:** Optional hybrid RSA+AES encryption for chat history and workflow logs (`crypto.server.ts`).
- **Auth Flow:** Google OAuth 2.0 → session cookies (httpOnly, 30-day). Tokens stored in session, refreshed automatically.
- **Settings:** Stored as `settings.json` in the user's Drive (`gemini-hub/` folder). Five categories: General, MCP Servers, RAG, Encryption, Edit History.

### Main IDE Layout

The index route (`_index.tsx`) renders the IDE with: Header (sync controls), LeftSidebar (Drive file tree), MainViewer (workflow canvas or markdown editor based on file type), RightSidebar (chat panel or workflow properties panel).

### Route Configuration

Routes are explicitly defined in `app/routes.ts` (not file-based). Page routes: `/` (dashboard), `/settings`, `/auth/*`. API routes: `/api/chat`, `/api/drive/*`, `/api/workflow/*`, `/api/settings/*`, `/api/sync`.
